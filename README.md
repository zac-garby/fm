# fm

This is a barely functional [FM synthesiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation_synthesis).

The goal is to have a synth which can immitate lots of different instruments, and a sequencer to play it. MIDI input should be pretty straightforward too, since I'm using libsoundio.

## Installation

First, you'll need to install [libsoundio](http://libsound.io). Then, to build the project it's as easy as typing `make fm`. `make run` will build it and then run the executable.

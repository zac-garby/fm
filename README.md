# cancrizans

(formerly `fm`)

A synthesiser. I'm currently in the process of porting the [old](https://github.com/zac-garby/fm/tree/old) C version to Rust, because segfaults are annoying.

Once this rewrite is complete, the features will include:

 - FM instruments with arbitrary custom algorithms and feedback loops etc
 - Songs, loadable and storable in a human-readable and human-editable format
 - A nice-looking GUI
 - `.wav` file export
 - Filters and effects
